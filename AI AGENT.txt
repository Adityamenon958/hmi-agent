AI AGENT BASICS - FOR INTERNS
====================================

PHASE 1: WHAT IS AN AI AGENT?
-----------------------------

1.1. The Big Picture
--------------------
- An **AI agent** is a software program that can make decisions and take actions to achieve a goal, often using artificial intelligence (AI) techniques.
- Think of it as a digital "employee" that can read, understand, and act on information, just like a human would.

**Key Features:**
- Receives Input: Gets data from the outside world (e.g., a document, a user request, sensor data).
- Understands/Processes: Uses AI (like language models, image recognition, etc.) to understand the input.
- Takes Action: Does something useful with that understanding (e.g., generates a design, writes code, sends an email).
- Gives Output: Returns a result or performs a task.

**Example:**
- The agent receives an FDS (Functional Design Specification) document.
- It understands what the HMI screen should look like.
- It generates a Figma design for the HMI screen.

1.2. How Does an AI Agent Work?
-------------------------------
1. Input: The agent gets some data (e.g., a document, a question, a set of instructions).
2. Perception/Understanding: The agent uses AI models (like GPT, image recognition, etc.) to "understand" the input.
3. Reasoning/Planning: The agent decides what to do next (e.g., plan out the steps needed to create a design).
4. Action: The agent performs actions (e.g., generating a design file, sending a message, controlling other software).
5. Output/Feedback: The agent gives you the result (e.g., a Figma file, a report, etc.).

1.3. Types of AI Agents
-----------------------
- Simple Agents: Follow basic rules (e.g., a chatbot that answers FAQs).
- Reactive Agents: Respond to the current situation, but don't plan ahead.
- Goal-Based Agents: Plan actions to achieve a specific goal (e.g., design an HMI screen).
- Learning Agents: Get better over time by learning from feedback.

1.4. Where Do AI Agents Live?
-----------------------------
- Web Apps: Most common. You interact with the agent via a website (like ChatGPT, or your IoT dashboard).
- Desktop Apps: Installed on your computer (e.g., Photoshop with AI plugins).
- APIs/Services: The agent runs on a server, and you interact with it via API calls.
- Embedded/Edge Devices: For IoT, sometimes the agent runs on a device (e.g., a smart thermostat).


PHASE 2: HOW TO BUILD AN AI AGENT
---------------------------------

Use Case: Automate the process of reading an FDS and generating an HMI screen design (e.g., in Figma).

2.1. What Skills/Tech Do You Need?
----------------------------------
- Programming Language:
  - Python is the most popular for AI (lots of libraries, easy to learn).
  - JavaScript/TypeScript (Node.js) is also used, especially for web-based agents.
- AI Models:
  - Language models (like GPT-4, Llama, etc.) for understanding documents.
  - Design generation tools (e.g., Figma API, or plugins).
- APIs:
  - To interact with Figma, you'll use the Figma API.
  - To use AI models, you might use OpenAI API, HuggingFace, or run models locally.
- Frontend/Backend:
  - You can build a web interface (React) for users to upload FDS and get designs.
  - Backend (Express, Flask, FastAPI) to handle the AI logic.

2.2. High-Level Architecture
----------------------------
User uploads FDS → Backend (AI Agent) → AI Model (understands FDS) → Figma API (creates design) → User downloads/opens Figma design

2.3. Step-by-Step: Building Your First AI Agent
-----------------------------------------------
Step 1: Define the Input and Output
- Input: FDS document (PDF, DOCX, or plain text)
- Output: Figma design file or link

Step 2: Choose Your Stack
- Backend: Python (Flask or FastAPI) or Node.js (Express)
- AI Model: OpenAI GPT-4 (via API)
- Figma API: To create designs programmatically

Step 3: Build the Backend
- Accept FDS uploads
- Send FDS content to AI model to extract requirements
- Use Figma API to create a design based on AI output

Step 4: Build the Frontend

PHASE 5: MODERN TOOLS FOR BUILDING AI AGENTS (n8n, LangChain, etc.)
-------------------------------------------------------------------

5.1. Why Use Online Tools and Frameworks?
-----------------------------------------
- Building an AI agent from scratch (as explained above) gives you full control, but it can be slow and complex.
- Today, there are powerful tools and platforms that make it much easier and faster to build, connect, and deploy AI agents—often with little or no code.


5.2. What is n8n?
------------------
- **n8n** is an open-source workflow automation tool (like Zapier, but more flexible and developer-friendly).
- You can visually connect different services (APIs, databases, AI models, etc.) using a drag-and-drop interface.
- n8n lets you build workflows ("automation pipelines") that can include AI steps, like calling GPT-4, processing documents, or triggering actions based on data.

**How does n8n work for AI agents?**
- You create a workflow: e.g., "When a new FDS document is uploaded, send it to GPT-4, process the response, and create a Figma design via API."
- Each step is a "node" (e.g., HTTP request, AI model, Figma API, etc.).
- You can chain together as many steps as you want, and even add logic (if/else, loops, etc.).
- You can run n8n on your own server (self-hosted) or use their cloud service.

**Can you make multiple agents?**
- Yes! Each workflow can be its own agent, or you can have one workflow that handles multiple tasks.

**How do you use/deploy it?**
- You can run n8n locally (on your laptop), on a server, or use n8n Cloud.
- You access it via a web browser.
- You can trigger workflows manually, on a schedule, or via webhooks (e.g., when a file is uploaded).


5.3. What is LangChain?
-----------------------
- **LangChain** is a framework (mainly for Python and JavaScript/TypeScript) for building applications powered by language models (like GPT-4).
- It helps you connect language models to data sources, APIs, tools, and even other AI models.
- LangChain is especially good for building "agentic" workflows, where the AI can make decisions, use tools, and interact with the outside world.

**How does LangChain work for AI agents?**
- You write code (Python or JS/TS) that defines how your agent should behave.
- LangChain provides building blocks for things like:
  - Connecting to LLMs (GPT-4, etc.)
  - Memory (so the agent can remember things)
  - Tool use (e.g., search, API calls, calculations)
  - Chaining steps together ("chains")
  - Creating multi-step agents that can reason and act
- You can deploy LangChain apps as web services, APIs, or even integrate them into web apps.

**Can you make multiple agents?**
- Yes! You can define as many agents as you want, each with its own logic and tools.

**How do you use/deploy it?**
- You run your LangChain code on your own server, in the cloud, or as part of a web app.
- You can expose it as an API, a chatbot, or any interface you want.


5.4. Comparison: Online Tools vs. Coding Your Own Agent
-------------------------------------------------------

| Approach         | Pros                                         | Cons                                        |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| n8n (No/Low Code)| - Fast to build and iterate                  | - Less control over fine details            |
|                  | - Visual, easy to understand                 | - May hit limits for very custom logic      |
|                  | - Great for connecting APIs and automations  | - Some features may require paid plan       |
| LangChain        | - Powerful, flexible, lots of AI features    | - Requires coding (Python/JS/TS)            |
|                  | - Built for agentic workflows                | - Can get complex for big projects          |
|                  | - Good community and docs                    |                                             |
| Code Your Own    | - Full control, fully custom                 | - Takes more time and effort                |
| (from scratch)   | - No platform lock-in                        | - Need to handle everything yourself        |
|                  | - Can optimize for your exact needs          | - Harder to maintain and scale              |


5.5. Which Should You Use?
--------------------------
- If you want to move fast, experiment, and connect existing tools: **Start with n8n or LangChain**.
- If you need something very custom, or want to learn deeply: **Try coding your own agent**.
- Many teams start with n8n/LangChain for prototyping, then build custom code as they scale.


5.6. Example: Building an AI Agent with n8n
-------------------------------------------
1. Install n8n (or use n8n Cloud).
2. Create a new workflow.
3. Add a trigger (e.g., "When file uploaded").
4. Add an HTTP Request node to send the FDS to OpenAI GPT-4.
5. Add logic nodes to process the response.
6. Add another HTTP Request node to call the Figma API and create a design.
7. Save and activate the workflow.

**Result:** You have an AI agent that automates HMI design, all without writing much code!


5.7. Example: Building an AI Agent with LangChain
-------------------------------------------------
1. Install LangChain (Python: `pip install langchain` or JS: `npm install langchain`).
2. Write code to:
   - Load the FDS document
   - Use a language model to extract requirements
   - Use LangChain tools to call the Figma API
   - Chain these steps together
3. Deploy your code as an API or web app.

**Result:** You have a flexible, programmable AI agent with lots of power and customization.


---

**Summary:**
- Modern tools like n8n and LangChain make it much easier to build and deploy AI agents.
- You can create one or many agents, automate complex workflows, and connect to almost any service.
- Choose the approach that fits your team's skills, timeline, and needs! 

FAQs: Frequently Asked Questions
===============================

Q1: Is LangChain only used when I want to code the agent myself in my code editor?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A: Yes, mostly!
LangChain is a coding framework (for Python or JavaScript/TypeScript), so you use it when you want to write code for your AI agent in your own code editor (like VS Code, Cursor, etc.).

- You write scripts or apps using LangChain's libraries.
- You have full control over the logic, tools, and integrations.
- You run your code locally, on a server, or deploy it as a web service.

LangChain is not a drag-and-drop or no-code tool. It's for developers who want to build more advanced, custom, or programmable AI agents by writing code. 

Q2: Do I have to change the prompts every time, or do they stay the same?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
A: The prompts usually stay the same! Think of prompts as templates or instructions for the AI. You write them once for each type of task (like designing a screen, mapping tags, etc.), and then reuse them. The only thing that changes each time is the input data (like the FDS document or machine type). This way, your agent can handle new projects without you having to rewrite prompts every time.

Q3: How does the agent use prompts and FDS documents together?
-------------------------------------------------------------
A: The agent takes a reusable prompt (template) and fills in the blanks with the new FDS document and any other details (like machine type). It then sends this filled-in prompt to the AI model, which reads the FDS and generates the output you want (like a screen design or tag mapping). The prompts stay the same, but the FDS and other inputs change for each project.

Q4: What is the correct method to make the agent work like an employee?
----------------------------------------------------------------------
A: Store a set of well-written prompts (templates) for each task your agent should handle. When a new FDS comes in, your agent fills in the prompt with the new data and sends it to the AI. The agent then uses the AI's output to create the HMI design or other deliverables. This method is consistent, scalable, and lets your agent automate the work just like a real employee would—without needing to rewrite prompts for every new project.

Q5: What can we do to make the agent more reliable and give the exact output we need? Do we need to train it?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A: You usually do NOT train the AI model yourself. Instead, you make your agent more reliable by:
- Writing better, clearer prompts (prompt engineering)
- Giving the AI all the info it needs (context, examples, etc.)
- Checking and validating the AI's output
- Adding logic to handle mistakes or unclear answers

You use pre-trained models (like GPT-4) and focus on how you ask questions and process the answers. Training the model itself is done by big AI companies, not by end users.

Q6: Will the agent learn and get better every time it does a task?
-----------------------------------------------------------------
A: By default, no. The AI model does NOT remember past projects or learn from its mistakes unless you build that logic yourself. Each time you send a prompt, it's a "fresh start" for the model. If you want the agent to get better over time, you can:
- Collect examples of good/bad outputs and improve your prompts
- Add feedback systems where users rate the output
- (Advanced) Use memory modules to store context for a session, but this is not the same as true learning

Q7: What are some ways to make the agent's output more reliable?
---------------------------------------------------------------
A: Here are some practical tips:
- Use clear, specific prompts and give examples if possible
- Tell the AI exactly what format/output you want
- Check the output after you get it (validation)
- If the output isn't right, try again with a revised prompt or alert a human to review
- Build feedback loops so users can rate or flag outputs for improvement

Q8: Do I need to train the AI model myself for business use cases?
------------------------------------------------------------------
A: No! For most business use cases, you use pre-trained models and focus on prompt engineering, validation, and workflow design. Training the model is only needed for very advanced or custom AI projects, and is usually done by big companies with lots of data and resources.

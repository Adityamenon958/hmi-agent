1. INTRODUCTION

This manual provides instructions for Designing and Development of the Human Machine Interface (HMI) device. The HMI is designed to interact with a Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) to monitor and control processes in various industrial applications.
Purpose: This operator document outlines the processes of SF6 & other Gas measuring modes of the machine. Ensuring proper and safe operations is essential for maintaining a high level of product quality and production efficiency.

2. HMI SYSTEM

Hardware and Software used for HMI system of base mixing plant process is as follow:
•	HMI Hardware: 7” Wecon With Ethernet
3. USER INTERFACE

The user interface (UI) is the point of human-computer interaction and communication in a device. This can include display screens, keyboards, a mouse and the appearance of a desktop. It is also how a user interacts with an application or a website, using visual and audio elements, such as type fonts, icons, buttons, animations and sounds.

Here in HMI, display screens are as HOME, MAIN, Sampling, Pumpback, Purging, Calibration, ALARMS and USER MANAGEMENT. 
On system power up system displays Home screen, which maintains for 10 sec and switch to Main Page.
1. Home:

5. USER MANAGEMENT:
User management is a system that handles activities related to individuals' access to devices, software, and services. It focuses on managing permissions for access and actions, as well as monitoring usage.
Key elements of user management include:
•	User Authentication: Verifying the identity of users through methods such as passwords, biometrics, or two-factor authentication.
•	User Authorization: Determining what actions a user is allowed to perform within a system based on their role and permissions.
•	Access Control: Defining and managing user access to specific resources and data within a system

      In the HMI Operator Manual, the user management access levels are detailed as follows:
1.	Administrator(Level1): Has full access to all functions and can add users.
2.	Viewer (Level 3): Can only view the system status, detailed screens and events.
Login: This button will enable login window for the user to login the system
Logout: This button will logout existing used from the system

 
By entering User Name and Password in this window customer will login to the system.
Here for Operator and Administrator , User Name and Password will be different.

for Operator and Administrator access level is shown as below:

Access Topic	Operator	Administrator
Operate Plant in Manual	YES	YES
Operate Plant in Auto	YES	YES
RECIPE EDIT	NO	        YES
Username		-
Password		-
